DIRAC
=====

DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control) INTERWARE is a software framework for distributed computing providing a complete solution to one (or more) user community requiring access to distributed resources. DIRAC builds a layer between the users and the resources offering a common interface to a number of heterogeneous providers, integrating them in a seamless manner, providing interoperability, at the same time as an optimized, transparent and reliable usage of the resources.

The Workload Management System with Pilot Jobs introduced by the DIRAC project is now widely used in various grid infrastructures. This concept allows to aggregate in a single system computing resources of different source & nature, such as computational grids, clouds or clusters, transparently for the end users.
