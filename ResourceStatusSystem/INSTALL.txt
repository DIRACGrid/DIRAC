Setup for BASIC USAGE 
=====================

WARNING: If you have doubts about the success of any step, DO NOT ACTIVATE RSS.
WARNING: REPORT FIRST to the DIRAC FORUM ! 

0.- CS Configuration

  The configuration for RSS sits under the following path on the CS
    /Operations/Defaults/RSSConfiguration2
  
  Please, make sure you have the following schema:
    /Operations/Defaults/RSSConfiguration2
        /Config
          State        = InActive
          Cache        = 300
          CacheHistory = 24
          RecordLogs   = Active
          /StatusTypes
              default = all
              StorageElement = ReadAccess,WriteAccess,CheckAccess,RemoveAccess
            
  For a more detailed explanation, take a look to the official documentation:
  http://diracgrid.org/files/docs/AdministratorGuide/Systems/ResourceStatus/configuration.html            


1.- Fresh DB 

  Needs a fresh DB installation. Only `ResourceStatusDB` is needed. Information
  on former ResourceStatusDB can be discarded. Delete the old database tables. If
  there is no old database, just install a new one as follows:
    $ dirac-install-db ResourceStatusDB

2.- Generate DB tables

  Issue the command to populate the DB with the tables that are actually going to
  be used.
    $ dirac-rss-setup -o LogLevel=INFO

3.- Run service(s)

  RSS - basic - needs the following service to be up and running:
  ResourceStatusSystem/ResourceStatus, please install it and make sure it is 
  running.  

4.- Populate tables
  
  Let's do it one by one to make it easier:
    $ dirac-rss-sync --element Site -o LogLevel=VERBOSE
    $ dirac-rss-sync --element Resource -o LogLevel=VERBOSE 
    $ dirac-rss-sync --element Node -o LogLevel=VERBOSE

  You can check the DB. You will find there are 4 times StorageElements on the 
  Resources table ( if you are still using the default config of step 0 ). If not,
  please report and DO NOT ACTIVATE RSS.


5.- Initialize Statuses for StorageElements 

  Copy over the values that we had on the CS for the StorageElements 
    $ dirac-rss-sync --init -o LogLevel=VERBOSE
    
  WARNING !: If the StorageElement does not have a particular StatusType declared
  WARNING !: on the CS, this script will set it to Banned. If that happens, you will
  WARNING !: have to issue the dirac-rss-status script over the elements that need
  WARNING !: to be fixed.


6.- Set statuses by HAND

  In case you entered the WARNING ! on point 4, you may need to identify the status
  of your StorageElements. Try to detect the Banned SEs using the following:
    $ dirac-rss-list-status --element Resource --elementType StorageElement --status Banned
    
  If is there any SE to be modified, you can do it as follows:
    $ dirac-rss-set-status --element Resource --name CERN-USER --statusType ReadAccess --status Active --reason "Why not?"
    # This matches all StatusTypes
    $ dirac-rss-set-status --element Resource --name CERN-USER --status Active --reason "Why not?"
       
7.- Activate RSS

  If you did not see any problem, activate RSS.
    /Operations/Defaults/RSSConfiguration2/Config
        State = Active 

8.- Agents

  There are few agents that are required:
    - SummarizeLogsAgent
    - DatabaseCleanerAgent   
  Please, install them and make sure they are up and running.
