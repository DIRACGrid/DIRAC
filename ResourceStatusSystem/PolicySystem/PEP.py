""" PEP

  PEP ( Policy Enforcement Point ) is the front-end of the whole Policy System.
  Any interaction with it must go through the PEP to ensure a smooth flow.
  
  Firstly, it loads the PDP ( Policy Decision Point ) which actually is the
  module doing all dirty work ( finding policies, running them, merging their
  results, etc... ). Indeed, the PEP takes the output of the PDP for a given set
  of parameters ( decissionParams ) and enforces the actions that apply ( also
  determined by the PDP output ).
