  """
    Base class for all the Handlers.
    It directly inherits from :py:class:`tornado.web.RequestHandler`

    Each HTTP request is served by a new instance of this class.

    For the sequence of method called, please refer to
    the `tornado documentation <https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/structure.html>`_.

    For compatibility with the existing :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.DISET.TransferClient.TransferClient`,
    the handler can define a method ``export_streamToClient``. This is the method that will be called
    whenever ``TransferClient.receiveFile`` is called. It is the equivalent of the DISET
    ``transfer_toClient``.
    Note that this is here only for compatibility, and we discourage using it for new purposes, as it is
    bound to disappear.

    The handler only define the ``post`` verb. Please refer to :py:meth:`.post` for the details.

    In order to create a handler for your service, it has to
    follow a certain skeleton::

      from DIRAC.Core.Tornado.Server.TornadoService import TornadoService
      class yourServiceHandler(TornadoService):

        # Called only once when the first
        # request for this handler arrives
        # Useful for initializing DB or so.
        # You don't need to use super or to call any parents method, it's managed by the server
        @classmethod
        def initializeHandler(cls, infosDict):
          '''Called only once when the first
             request for this handler arrives
             Useful for initializing DB or so.
             You don't need to use super or to call any parents method, it's managed by the server
          '''
          pass


        def initializeRequest(self):
          '''
             Called at the beginning of each request
          '''
          pass

        # Specify the default permission for the method
        # See :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.DISET.AuthManager.AuthManager`
        auth_someMethod = ['authenticated']


        def export_someMethod(self):
          '''The method you want to export.
           It must start with ``export_``
           and it must return an S_OK/S_ERROR structure
          '''
          return S_ERROR()


        def export_streamToClient(self, myDataToSend, token):
          ''' Automatically called when ``Transfer.receiveFile`` is called.
              Contrary to the other ``export_`` methods, it does not need
              to return a DIRAC structure.
          '''

          # Do whatever with the token

          with open(myFileToSend, 'r') as fd:
            return fd.read()


    Note that because we inherit from :py:class:`tornado.web.RequestHandler`
    and we are running using executors, the methods you export cannot write
    back directly to the client. Please see inline comments for more details.

    In order to pass information around and keep some states, we use instance attributes.
    These are initialized in the :py:meth:`.initialize` method.
