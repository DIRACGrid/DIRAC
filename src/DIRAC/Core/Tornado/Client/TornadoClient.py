"""
  TornadoClient is equivalent of the RPCClient but in HTTPS.
  Usage of TornadoClient is the same as RPCClient, you can instantiate TornadoClient with
  complete url (https://host:port/System/Component) or just "System/Component". Like RPCClient
  you can use all method defined in your service, your call will be automatically transformed
  in RPC.

  It also exposes the same interface for receiving file as the TransferClient.

  Main changes:

  - KeepAliveLapse is removed, requests library manages it itself.
  - nbOfRetry (defined as private attribute) is removed, requests library manage it itself.
  - Underneath it uses HTTP POST protocol and JSON. See  :ref:`httpsTornado` for details

  Example::

    from DIRAC.Core.Tornado.Client.TornadoClient import TornadoClient
    myService = TornadoClient("Framework/MyService")
    myService.doSomething() #Returns S_OK/S_ERROR
