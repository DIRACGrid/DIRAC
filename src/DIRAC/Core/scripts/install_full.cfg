  #   These are options for the configuration of the installed DIRAC software
  #   i.e., to produce the initial dirac.cfg for the server
  #
  #  Give a Name to your User Community, it does not need to be the same name as in EGI,
  #  it can be used to cover more than one VO in the grid sense

  #  installed by some external means

  #  Service in your installation, for the primary server it should not used )

  #   These options define the DIRAC components to be installed on "this" DIRAC server.

  #  DN of the Admin user certificate (default: None )
  #  In order the find out the DN that needs to be included in the Configuration for a given
  #  host or user certificate the following command can be used::

  #          openssl x509 -noout -subject -enddate -in <certfile.pem>
