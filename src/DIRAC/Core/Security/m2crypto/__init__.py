# List of OIDs used in handling VOMS extension.
# VOMS extension is encoded in ASN.1 format and it's surprisingly hard to decode. OIDs describe content of sections
# of the data. There is no "official list of OIDs", ones used here are sourced from analyzing VOMS extensions itself
# and different pieces of code and presentations in subject of X509 certificates, certificate extensions and VOMS.
# Googling names or values of those OIDs, especially VOMS related, usually result in up to three pages of results,
# mainly Java code defining those values like code below.
# This is literally lookup table, so I know WTH is this, when I read value and see '1.3.6.1.4.1.8005.100.100.4'.
