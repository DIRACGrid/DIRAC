    """ A client requests a security token by making a token request to the
        authorization server's token endpoint using the extension grant type
        mechanism defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC6749].

        Client authentication to the authorization server is done using the
        normal mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0.  Section 2.3.1 of [RFC6749]
        defines password-based authentication of the client, however, client
        authentication is extensible and other mechanisms are possible.  For
        example, [RFC7523] defines client authentication using bearer JSON
        Web Tokens (JWTs) [JWT].  The supported methods of client
        authentication and whether or not to allow unauthenticated or
        unidentified clients are deployment decisions that are at the
        discretion of the authorization server.  Note that omitting client
        authentication allows for a compromised token to be leveraged via an
        STS into other tokens by anyone possessing the compromised token.
        Thus, client authentication allows for additional authorization
        checks by the STS as to which entities are permitted to impersonate
        or receive delegations from other entities.

        The client makes a token exchange request to the token endpoint with
        an extension grant type using the HTTP "POST" method.  The following
        parameters are included in the HTTP request entity-body using the
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format with a character encoding
        of UTF-8 as described in Appendix B of [RFC6749], per Section 6:

        grant_type
            REQUIRED.  The value "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-
            exchange" indicates that a token exchange is being performed.

        resource
            OPTIONAL.  A URI that indicates the target service or resource
            where the client intends to use the requested security token.
            This enables the authorization server to apply policy as
            appropriate for the target, such as determining the type and
            content of the token to be issued or if and how the token is to be
            encrypted.  In many cases, a client will not have knowledge of the
            logical organization of the systems with which it interacts and
            will only know a URI of the service where it intends to use the
            token.  The "resource" parameter allows the client to indicate to
            the authorization server where it intends to use the issued token
            by providing the location, typically as an https URL, in the token
            exchange request in the same form that will be used to access that
            resource.  The authorization server will typically have the
            capability to map from a resource URI value to an appropriate
            policy.  The value of the "resource" parameter MUST be an absolute
            URI, as specified by Section 4.3 of [RFC3986], that MAY include a
            query component and MUST NOT include a fragment component.
            Multiple "resource" parameters may be used to indicate that the
            issued token is intended to be used at the multiple resources
            listed.  See [OAUTH-RESOURCE] for additional background and uses
            of the "resource" parameter.

        audience
            OPTIONAL.  The logical name of the target service where the client
            intends to use the requested security token.  This serves a
            purpose similar to the "resource" parameter but with the client
            providing a logical name for the target service.  Interpretation
            of the name requires that the value be something that both the
            client and the authorization server understand.  An OAuth client
            identifier, a SAML entity identifier [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], and
            an OpenID Connect Issuer Identifier [OpenID.Core] are examples of
            things that might be used as "audience" parameter values.
            However, "audience" values used with a given authorization server
            must be unique within that server to ensure that they are properly
            interpreted as the intended type of value.  Multiple "audience"
            parameters may be used to indicate that the issued token is
            intended to be used at the multiple audiences listed.  The
            "audience" and "resource" parameters may be used together to
            indicate multiple target services with a mix of logical names and
            resource URIs.

        scope
            OPTIONAL.  A list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings, as
            defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC6749], that allow the client to
            specify the desired scope of the requested security token in the
            context of the service or resource where the token will be used.
            The values and associated semantics of scope are service specific
            and expected to be described in the relevant service
            documentation.

        requested_token_type
            OPTIONAL.  An identifier, as described in Section 3, for the type
            of the requested security token.  If the requested type is
            unspecified, the issued token type is at the discretion of the
            authorization server and may be dictated by knowledge of the
            requirements of the service or resource indicated by the
            "resource" or "audience" parameter.

        subject_token
            REQUIRED.  A security token that represents the identity of the
            party on behalf of whom the request is being made.  Typically, the
            subject of this token will be the subject of the security token
            issued in response to the request.

        subject_token_type
            REQUIRED.  An identifier, as described in Section 3, that
            indicates the type of the security token in the "subject_token"
            parameter.

        actor_token
            OPTIONAL.  A security token that represents the identity of the
            acting party.  Typically, this will be the party that is
            authorized to use the requested security token and act on behalf
            of the subject.

        actor_token_type
            An identifier, as described in Section 3, that indicates the type
            of the security token in the "actor_token" parameter.  This is
            REQUIRED when the "actor_token" parameter is present in the
            request but MUST NOT be included otherwise.
