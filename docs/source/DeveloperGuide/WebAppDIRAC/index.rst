WebAppDIRAC
===========

The new DIRAC web framework provides many facilities to develop and test web applications.
This framework loads each application in a separate window, and these windows can be arranged at the
desktop area by means of resizing, moving and pinning. In this tutorial we are going to explain the ways
of developing and testing new applications.

Before you start this tutorial, it is desirable that you have some experience with programming in
Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS scripting, client-server communication
(such as AJAX and web sockets) and sufficient knowledge in object-oriented programming.
If you are not familiar with some of the web technologies, or there has been a while since you used
those technologies, please visit the W3CSchool web site (`<http://www.w3schools.com/>`_).
There, you can find tutorials that you can use to learn or to refresh your knowledge for web-programming.
