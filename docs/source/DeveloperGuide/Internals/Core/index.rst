Client Service Interactions

Clients

The client can interact with services using RPC calls. DIRAC provides an abstraction which allows to easily add new clients.


.. graphviz::

   digraph {
   YourClient -> Client [label=inherit];
   Client -> RPCClient [label=use];
   RPCClient -> InnerRPCClient [label=use];
   TransferClient -> BaseClient [label=inherit];
   InnerRPCClient -> BaseClient [label=inherit];
   BaseClient -> Transports [label=use];

   YourClient  [shape=polygon,sides=4];
   Client  [shape=polygon,sides=4, label = "DIRAC.Core.Base.Client"];
   RPCClient  [shape=polygon,sides=4, label = "DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient"];
   InnerRPCClient  [shape=polygon,sides=4, label = "DIRAC.Core.DISET.private.InnerRPCClient"];
   TransferClient  [shape=polygon,sides=4, label = "DIRAC.Core.DISET.private.TransferClient"];
   BaseClient [shape=polygon,sides=4, label = "DIRAC.Core.DISET.private.BaseClient"] ;
   Transports [shape=polygon,sides=4];
   }




The BaseClient class contains the low level logic to discover the URLs from System/Component, the connection retry and failover mechanism, the discovery of the credentials to use, and the mechanism to initialize actions with the server. It relies on a Transport class to actually perform the communication.

InnerRPCClient inherits from BaseClient, and just contain the logic to perform an RPC call: it proposes to the server an RPC action. TransferClient implements the FileTransfer logic.

RPCClient translates non existing methods into RPC calls. It does this by using an InnerRPCClient.

the Client class contains a similar logic to emulate methods, but parses specific arguments at each call (url, rpc and timeout) to instantiate an RPCClient. All parameters given to it at initialization will be passed to RPCClient, and propagated down to BaseClient.

Refer to the code documentation of each class for more details. It is good to know however that many connection details can be specified at the creation of the client, and are not necessarily taken from the environment, like the proxy to use.

Here is a rough overview of what is happening when you are calling a method from a client.

.. code-block:: python

   from DIRAC.Core.Base.Cliet import Client

   c = Client()
   c.serverURL('DataManagement/FileCatalog') # The subclient would have to define it themselves as well

   # This returns a function pointing to Client.executeRPC
   pingMethod = c.ping
   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.Base.Client.Client'>.__getattr__(('ping',))

   # When performing the executiong, the whole chain happens
   pingMethod()


   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.Base.Client.Client'>.executeRPC(): this parses the specific arguments URL and  timeout
   #   if given in the call parameters
   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.Base.Client.Client'>._getRPC(False, '', 120): we generate an RPCClient
   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient.RPCClient'>.__getattr__('ping'): we forward the call to the RPCClient
   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient.RPCClient'>.__doRPC('ping',()): the RPCClient emulates the existance of the
   #   function and forwards it to the InnerRPCClient
   # Calling <class 'DIRAC.Core.DISET.private.InnerRPCClient.InnerRPCClient'>.executeRPC('ping', ()): the RPC call is finally
   #   executed

   ThreadConfig
   ============

   This special class is to be used in case you want to execute an operation on behalf of somebody else. Typically the WebApp uses it. This object is a singleton, but all its attributes are thread local. The host/identity wanting to use that requires the TrustedHost property.

   Let's take an example

   .. code-block:: python

      from DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient import RPCClient
      rpc = RPCClient('System/Component')

      rpc.ping()

   In the previous code, the code will be executed as whatever is set in the environment: host certificate or proxy.

   .. code-block:: python

      from DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient import RPCClient
      from DIRAC.Core.DISET.ThreadConfig import ThreadConfig

      thConfig = ThreadConfig()
      thConfig.setDN('/Whatever/User')

      rpc = RPCClient('System/Component')
      rpc.ping()

   In that case, the call will still be performed using whatever is set in the environment, however the remote service will act as if the request was done by ``/Whatever/user`` (providing that the TrustedHost property is granted).
   And because of the ``threading.local`` inheritance, we can have separate users actions like bellow.

   .. code-block:: python

     import threading
     from DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient import RPCClient
     from DIRAC.Core.DISET.ThreadConfig import ThreadConfig

     thConfig = ThreadConfig()

     class myThread (threading.Thread):

       def __init__(self, name):
	  super(myThread, self).__init__()
	  self.name = name

       def run(self):
	  thConfig.setDN(self.name)
	  rpc = RPCClient('DataManagement/FileCatalog')
	  rpc.ping()


     threads = []

     thread1 = myThread("/Whatever/user1")
     thread2 = myThread("/Whatever/user2")

     thread1.start()
     thread2.start()

     # Add threads to thread list
     threads.append(thread1)
     threads.append(thread2)

     # Wait for all threads to complete
     for t in threads:
	t.join()
