=====================================
Testing a service while developing it
=====================================

As described in :ref:`testing_environment` a way to test a service is to run an integration test, that can run when the service is actually running. It is also possible to write a proper unit test, but this is not the usually recommended way. Reasons are:

* It's not trivial to write a unit test for a service: reason being, the DIRAC framework can't be easily mocked.
* The code inside a service is (should be) simple, no logic should be embedded in there: so, what you want to test, is its integration.

Exercise 1:
-----------

Write an integration test for HelloHandler. This test should use python unittest, and should assume that the Hello service is running. The test stub follows:

.. code-block:: python

   # imports
   import unittest
   # sut
   from DIRAC.Core.DISET.RPCClient import RPCClient

   class TestHelloHandler( unittest.TestCase ):

     def setUp( self ):
       self.helloService = RPCClient('Framework/Hello')

     def tearDown( self ):
       pass

   class TestHelloHandlerSuccess( TestHelloHandler ):

     def test_success( self ):


   class TestHelloHandlerFailure( TestHelloHandler ):

     def test_failure( self ):



   if __name__ == '__main__':
     suite = unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromTestCase( TestHelloHandler )
     suite.addTest( unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromTestCase( TestHelloHandlerSuccess ) )
     suite.addTest( unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromTestCase( TestHelloHandlerFailure ) )
     testResult = unittest.TextTestRunner( verbosity = 2 ).run( suite )


As said, examples can be found in the DIRAC/tests package.
