The job parameters the same as in the job JDL description are entered
in the corresponding fields. Use the *Add parameters* menu to add fields
for more parameters. Add any number of files to ship in the job input sandbox
by just finding them in you local file system.

Once the job description is complete, press the *Submit* button to launch
the job. You can modify any parameter and submit a new job without restarting
from scratch.
