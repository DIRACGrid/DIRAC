Installing DIRAC client
=======================

The DIRAC client installation procedure consists of few steps.
You can do these steps as any user without the need to be root.

Install a python2 client
------------------------

Choose the directory where you want to install the DIRAC software and run the dirac-install and dirac-configure scripts from
this directory::

   wget -np -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIRACGrid/management/master/dirac-install.py --no-check-certificate
   chmod +x dirac-install.py
   ./dirac-install.py -r v7r2 -t client
   source bashrc
   dirac-proxy-init --nocs
   dirac-configure -S DIRAC-Certification -C dips://some.whe.re:9135/Configuration/Server --SkipCAChecks

The example above assumes that you need the release version v7r2.

Install a python3 client
------------------------

Python3 DIRAC installations rely on the environment provided by `DIRACOS2 <https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRACOS2>`_.
So, you first install DIRACOS2 and only then install DIRAC in it::

    https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRACOS2/releases/latest/download/DIRACOS-Linux-$(uname -m).sh
    bash DIRACOS-Linux-$(uname -m).sh
    rm DIRACOS-Linux-$(uname -m).sh
    source diracos/diracosrc

and now DIRAC::

    pip install DIRAC==7.2

(Just `pip install DIRAC` will install the most recent production version found on https://pypi.org/project/DIRAC/)

And for the configuration::

    dirac-configure


Using a user proxy
------------------

If you want to use a user proxy, we assume that you already have a user certificate,
so in this case create a directory *.globus* in your home directory and copy the certificate files
(public and private keys in .pem (Privacy Enhanced Mail format) to this directory::

   $ mkdir ~/.globus
   $ cp <<certificate files>> ~/.globus/

At this point you need a proxy, but you still have not configured DIRAC. So, you should issue the command::

   $ dirac-proxy-init

You can see which file is your proxy certificate using the *dirac-proxy-info* command.

Updating client
----------------

The client software update, when a new version is available, can be simply done by running again the *dirac-install*
command for python2 installations, or pip for python3 installations.
