DIRAC Setup Structure
==========================================

The basic DIRAC components are *Services*, *Agents*, and *Executors*.

  *Services* 
    are passive components listening to incoming client requests and reacting accordingly by
    serving requested information from the *Database* backend or inserting requests on the
    *Database* backend. *Services* themselves can be clients of other *Services* from the same
    DIRAC *System* or from other *Systems*.

  *Agents* 
    are active components, similar to cron jobs, which execution is invoked periodically.
    Agents are animating the whole system by executing actions, sending requests
    to the DIRAC or third party services.

  *Executors* 
    are also active components, similar to consumers of a message queue system, which execution is invoked at request.
    Executors are used within the DIRAC Workload Management System.


These components are combined together to form *Systems*.
a *System* is delivering a complex functionality to the rest of DIRAC, providing a solution for a given class of tasks.
Examples of *Systems* are Workload Management System or Configuration System or Data Management System.

And then there are databses, which keep the persistent state of a *System*.
They are accessed by Services and Agents as a kind of shared memory.

To achieve a functional DIRAC installation, cooperation of different *Systems* is required. 
A set of *Systems* providing a complete functionality to the end user form a DIRAC *Setup*.
All DIRAC client installations will point to a particular DIRAC *Setup*. *Setups* can span
multiple server installations. Each server installation belongs to a DIRAC *Instance* that can 
be shared by multiple *Setups*.

A *Setup* is the highest level of the DIRAC component hierarchy. *Setups* are combining
together instances of *Systems*. Within a given installation there may be several *Setups*. 
For example, there can be "Production" *Setup* together with "Test" or "Certification" 
*Setups* used for development and testing of the new functionality. An instance of a *System* 
can belong to one or more *Setups*, in other words, different *Setups* can share some *System* 
instances. Multiple *Setups* for the given community share the same Configuration information
which allows them to access the same computing resources.

Each *System* and *Setup* instance has a distinct name. The mapping of *Systems* to
*Setups* is described in the Configuration of the DIRAC installation in the "/DIRAC/Setups"
section.
