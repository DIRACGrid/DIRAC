Systems / WorkloadManagement / <INSTANCE> / Agents / StalledJobAgent - Sub-subsection
======================================================================================

The StalledJobAgent hunts for stalled jobs in the Job database. Jobs in "running"state not receiving a 
heart beat signal for more than stalledTime seconds will be assigned the "Stalled" state.

The FailedTimeHours and StalledTimeHours are actually given in number of cycles. One Cycle is 30 minutes
and can be changed in the Systems/WorkloadManagement/<Instance>/JobWrapper section with the CheckingTime
and MinCheckingTime options
