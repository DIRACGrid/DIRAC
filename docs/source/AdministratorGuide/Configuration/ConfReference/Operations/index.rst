Operations - Section
====================

This section allows to configure options concerning to:

- Scheduling
- Pilots
- InputDataPolicy
- Job description
- Service Shifters
- Virtual Organization special parameters
- Transformations

In the short term, most of this schema will be moved into [vo]/[setup] dependent sections in order to allow better support for multi-VO installations.
