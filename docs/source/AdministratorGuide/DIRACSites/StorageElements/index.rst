Storage Elements
=========================

A named SE is an SE in the DIRAC sense, in other words, as seen by the DIRAC users.

Different named SEs can point to the same StorageElement server, and make use of different options to upload/retrieve data from different backend storages.
For instance a different base path or a different SRM Space Token for different types of data. 

In general the SE name is a logical name and not a hostname.

Detailed information about SEs can be found :ref:`here <resourcesStorageElement>`__.
