Overview
=========

The Monitoring system is used to monitor various components of DIRAC. Currently, we have several monitoring types:

  - WMSHistory: for monitoring the history of jobs.
  - PilotsHistory: for monitoring of the history of pilots.
  - Agent Monitoring: for monitoring the activity of DIRAC agents.
  - Service Monitoring: for monitoring the activity of DIRAC services.
  - RMS Monitoring: for monitoring the DIRAC RequestManagement System (mostly the Request Executing Agent).
  - PilotSubmission Monitoring: for monitoring the DIRAC pilot submission statistics from SiteDirector agents.
  - DataOperation Monitoring: for monitoring the DIRAC data operation statistics as well as individual failures from interactive use of ``StorageElement``.

It is based on Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) distributed search and analytics NoSQL database.
If you want to use it, you have to install the Monitoring service, and of course connect to a ElasticSearch instance.

Install Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
================================

This is not covered here, as installation and administration of ES are not part of DIRAC guide.
Just a note on the ES versions supported: only ES7+ versions are currently supported, and are later to be replaced by OpenSearch services.

Configure the MonitoringSystem
===============================

You can run your Elastic/OpenSearch cluster even without authentication, or using User name and password. You have to add the following parameters:

  - User
  - Password
  - Host
  - Port

The *User* name and *Password* must be added to the local cfg file while the other can be added to the CS using the Configuration web application.
You have to handle the ES secret information in a similar way to what is done for the other supported SQL databases, e.g. MySQL.


For example::

   Systems
   {
     NoSQLDatabases
     {
       User = test
       Password = password
     }
   }


The following option can be set in `Systems/Monitoring/<Setup>/Databases/MonitoringDB`:

   *IndexPrefix*:  Prefix used to prepend to indexes created in the ES instance. If this
                   is not present in the CS, the indices are prefixed with the setup name.

For each monitoring types managed, the Period (how often a new index is created)
can be defined with::

   MonitoringTypes
   {
     RMSMonitoring
     {
       # Indexing strategy. Possible values: day, week, month, year, null
       Period = month
     }
     WMSHistory
     {
       # Indexing strategy. Possible values: day, week, month, year, null
       Period = day
     }
   }

The given periods above are also the default periods in the code.

Enable the Monitoring System
============================

In order to enable the monitoring of all the following types with an ElasticSearch-based backend, you should add the value `Monitoring` to the flag
`MonitoringBackends/Default` in the Operations section of the CS.
If you want to override this flag for a specific type, say, you want to only have Monitoring (and no Accounting) for WMSHistory, you just create a flag `WMSHistory` set to `Monitoring`.
If, for example, you want both Monitoring and Accounting for WMSHistory (but not for other types), you set `WMSHistory = Accounting, Monitoring`. If no flag is set for `WMSHistory`, the `Default` flag will be used.

So what this does then is to first check if there is a specific flag for the type in question and then enable it, but if no specific flag is set for the type, the `Default` will be used.

This can be done either via the CS or directly in the web app in the Configuration Manager as following::

   Operations
   {
     <VO|Setup|Defaults>
     {
       MonitoringBackends
       {
         # WMSHistory = Monitoring
         # DataOperation = Accounting, Monitoring
         # PilotsHistory = ...
         # PilotSubmissionMonitoring = Accounting
         # AgentMonitoring = ...
         # ServiceMonitoring = ...
         # RMSMonitoring = ...
       }
     }
   }

WMSHistory & PilotsHistory Monitoring
=====================================

The WorkloadManagement/StatesAccountingAgent creates, every 15 minutes, a snapshot with the contents of JobDB and PilotAgentsDB and sends it to an Elasticsearch-based database.
This same agent can also report the WMSHistory to the MySQL backend used by the Accounting system (which is in fact the default).

Optionally, you can use an MQ system (like ActiveMQ) for failover, even though the agent already has a simple failover mechanism.
You can configure the MQ in the local dirac.cfg file where the agent is running::

   Resources
   {
     MQServices
     {
       hostname.some.where
       {
         MQType = Stomp
         Port = 61613
         User = monitoring
         Password = seecret
         Queues
         {
           WMSHistory
           {
             Acknowledgement = True
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }


Monitoring of DIRAC Agents and Services
=======================================

When enabled, this will report the activity of DIRAC agents and services, including parameters such as CPU and Memory usage, but also cycle duration of
agents, or response time, queries and threads of the services.


RMS Monitoring
==============

This type is used to monitor behaviour pattern of requests executed by RequestManagementSystem.

PilotSubmission Monitoring
==========================

This monitoring type reports statistics of the pilot submissions done by the SiteDirector, including parameters such as the total number of submissions and the succeded ones.

Data Operation Monitoring
=========================

This monitoring enables the reporting of information about the data operation such as the cumulative transfer size or the number of succeded and failed transfers.

It will also fill an index called ``faileddataoperation_index`` containing entries for individual interactive failures (CLI, Job, etc).


Accessing the Monitoring information
=====================================

After you installed and configured the Monitoring system, you can use the Monitoring web application for the types WMSHistory and RMS.

However, every type can directly be monitored in Kibana dashboards that can be imported into your Elasticsearch (or Opensearch) instance. You can find and import these dashboards from DIRAC/dashboards as per the following example.
Grafana dashboards are also provided for some of the types.

*Kibana dashboard for WMSHistory*
  A dashboard for WMSHistory monitoring ``WMSDashboard`` is available `here <https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/tree/integration/dashboards/WMSDashboard>`__ for import as a NDJSON (as support for JSON is being removed in the latest versions of Kibana).
  The dashboard may not be compatible with older versions of ElasticSearch.
  To import it in the Kibana UI, go to Management -> Saved Objects -> Import and import the JSON file.

  Note: the JSON file already contains the index patterns needed for the visualizations. You may need to adapt the index patterns to your existing ones.
