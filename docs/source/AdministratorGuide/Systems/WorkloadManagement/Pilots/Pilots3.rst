====================
Pilots bootstrapping
====================


Pilot3 needs some Python files, and a JSON file for bootstrapping. We simply call this file the ``pilot.json`` file.
The ``pilot.json`` file is created starting from information found in the Configuration Service.

The pilot wrapper (the script that starts the pilot, which is effectively equivalent to what SiteDirectors send)
expects to find and download such a ``pilot.json`` file from a known location, or a set of them.
Such a location should be exposed via *https://* by, for example, the DIRAC WebApp webserver (but not necessarily).

To make sure that the ``pilot.json`` is created and uploaded, there's an agent that can be used for your convenience: the agent **PilotsSyncAgent** syncs CS and pilot files to a web server of your choice.
The (list of) location(s) where the agent would upload the pilot files can be added in the CS agent option *UploadLocations*. If this location is not set, then the agent will try to use the *Operations* option *Pilot/pilotFileServer*.

If more than one location is used, add them as a list.
We suggest to add at least the URL of the DIRAC WebApp webserver, but multiple locations are also possible, and advised.


Starting with DIRAC version v7r2, the file uploads is completely on the balancer (nginx) side.
Make sure your balancer is set to load files by following the :ref:`instructions <configure_nginx>`.



Other options that can be set also in the Operations part of the CS include:

Pilots environment
==================

There is a small number of environment variables that can be set by the pilot to control the behaviour of DIRAC jobs.

DIRAC_PROCESSORS
  The number of processors the pilot can use

DIRAC_JOB_PROCESSORS
  The number of processors the jobs administered by the pilot can use (a subset of DIRAC_PROCESSORS)

DIRAC_WHOLENODE
  A boolean flag indicating the pilot is exploiting the whole node (normally, False)


Install non-released code from within the Pilot
===============================================

To install non-released code from within the pilot, the dirac-pilot command can be run with the --modules option. This option can be steered from the CS too.

For example::

   dirac-pilot.py --modules=https://github.com/chaen/DIRAC.git:::DIRAC:::rel-v7r3_FEAT_proxyStrength

would end up installing a specific branch (``rel-v7r3_FEAT_proxyStrength``) pushed to github by user `chaen`.

An easy way to try is to add the ``Modules`` option in the CS configuration of one of your ComputingElements::

    Modules=https://github.com/chaen/DIRAC.git:::DIRAC:::rel-v7r3_FEAT_proxyStrength
