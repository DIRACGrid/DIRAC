DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control) INTERWARE is a software framework for distributed computing providing a complete solution to one or more user community requiring access to distributed resources. DIRAC builds a layer between the users and the resources offering a common interface to a number of heterogeneous providers, integrating them in a seamless manner, providing interoperability, at the same time as an optimized, transparent and reliable usage of the resources.

DIRAC has been started by the `LHCb collaboration <https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/>`_ who still maintains it. It is now used by several communities (AKA VO=Virtual Organizations) for their distributed computing workflows.
