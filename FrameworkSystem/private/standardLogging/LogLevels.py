  """
  Wrapper of the old LogLevels class.
  LogLevels is used to integrate custom levels to logging: verbose, notice and always.

  It is useful to make conversion string-integer.
  In fact, logging use only integers while the oldgLogger used strings, so we need a converter.
  Example: log.setLevel(logging.ALWAYS) in 'logging' become log.setLevel("always") in gLogger.
  We keep the string form because there are many and many calls with string levels.

  There is a method named getLevelName in 'logging' which could do almost the same job, but with logging,
  we can not return all level names in one time
  and the method getLevelName does not return errors or None values when a level
  does not exist. So at the moment, the LogLevels class is useful.
