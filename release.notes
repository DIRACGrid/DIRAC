     MAX_LEVELS variable
FIX: FileCatalog - Directory metadata is deleted together with the directory deletion, issue #40    
CHANGE: FileCatalog - the logic of the files query by metadata revisited to increase efficiency

     try the import only once and just when LcgFileCatalogClient class is intantiated

has moved forward to another status, the Stager will get an S_OK and
should forget about the job.

     StageRequest agent will have proper accounting of the amount of staged data in cache.
NEW: FTSCleaningAgent will allow to fix transient errors in RequestDB. At the moment it's 
     only fixing Requests for which SourceTURL is equal to TargetSURL.
