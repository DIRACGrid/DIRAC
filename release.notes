     MAX_LEVELS variable
FIX: FileCatalog - Directory metadata is deleted together with the directory deletion, issue #40    
CHANGE: FileCatalog - the logic of the files query by metadata revisited to increase efficiency

     StageRequest agent will have proper accounting of the amount of staged data in cache.
