     to get only replicas that can be used for jobs (as defined in the CS); added
     getReplicasForJobs(), also used in the Dirac API

        changes, e.g. RFC type proxies           

*DMS
NEW: Next in implementation multi-protocol support for storage elements. When performing 
     an action on the StorageElement, instead of looping over all the protocol plugins, 
     we loop over a filtered list. This list is built taking into account which action 
     is taken (read vs write), and is also sorted according to lists defined in the CS.
     The negotiation for third party transfer is also improved: it takes into account all 
     possible protocols the source SE is able to produce, and all protocols the target is 
     able to receive as input.
NEW: StorageElement - added methods for monitoring used disk space
