DIRAC Integration tests
=======================

These folders contain all the integration tests for DIRAC code. With integration tests we mean those tests that:

- might require at least on database to be set up
- might require at least one service to run

Details about how to run these tests locally can be found on `readthedocs<https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DeveloperGuide/CodeTesting/index.html#running-integration-tests-locally>`_.
