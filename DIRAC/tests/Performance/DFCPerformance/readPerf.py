""" This script instantiate a DFC client against a given service,
    and hammers it with read request (listDirectory) for a given time.
    It produces two files : time.txt and clock.txt which contain time measurement,
    using time.time and time.clock (see respective doc)
    It assumes that the DB has been filled with the scripts in generateDB

    Tunable parameters:
      * maxDuration : time it will run. Cannot be too long, otherwise job
                      is killed because staled
      * port: list of ports on which we can find a service (assumes all the service running on one machine)
      * hostname: name of the host hosting the service
      * readDepth: depth of the path when reading


The depths are to be put in relation with the depths you used to generate the db
