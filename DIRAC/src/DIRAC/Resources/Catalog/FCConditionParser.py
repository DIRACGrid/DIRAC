    The conditions are expressed as boolean logic, where the basic bloc has
    the form "pluginName=whateverThatWillBePassedToThePlugin".
    The basic blocs will be evaluated by the respective plugins, and the result can
    be combined using the standard boolean operators::

    evaluated by a plugin.

    from the CS depending on the context (see doc of __call__ and __getConditionFromCS)
