  This modules defines two functions that can be used in place of the ``RPCClient`` and
  ``TransferClient`` to transparently switch to ``https``.

  Example::

    from DIRAC.Core.Tornado.Client.ClientSelector import RPCClientSelector as RPCClient
    myService = RPCClient("Framework/MyService")

def ClientSelector(disetClient, *args, **kwargs):  # We use same interface as RPCClient
    """
    Select the correct Client (either RPC or Transfer ), instantiate it, and return it.

    The selection is based on the URL:

    * either it contains the protocol, in which case we make a choice
    * or it is in the form <Component/Service>, in which case we resolve first

    This is a generic function. You should rather use :py:class:`.RPCClientSelector`
    or :py:class:`.TransferClientSelector`


    In principle, the only place for this class to be used is in
    :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.Base.Client.Client`, since it is the only
    one supposed to instantiate an :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.Base.DISET.RPCClient.RPCClient`

    :params disetClient: the DISET class to be instantiated, so either
        :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.Base.DISET.RPCClient.RPCClient`
        or :py:class:`DIRAC.Core.Base.DISET.TransferClient.TransferClient`
    :param args: Whatever ``disetClient`` takes as args, but the first one is
        always the URL we want to rely on.
        It can be either "system/service" or "dips://domain:port/system/service"
    :param kwargs: This can contain:

      * Whatever ``disetClient`` takes.
      * httpsClient: specific class inheriting from TornadoClient
