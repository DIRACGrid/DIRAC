How to build DIRAC documentation
=================================

1. Create DIRAC client environment by an appropriate
   source bashrc

2. Go to the Documentation directory of the DIRAC source code repository
   cd DIRAC/docs/
   export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/diracdoctools:$PYTHONPATH

3. Run the documentation building script

   This also creates all the automatically generated rst files

      make htmlall

3.1 to run incremental builds after rst files have changed, only run

   make html

3.2 The automatic creation of the CodeDocumentation, Command References, and example cfg can also be run from the
    DIRAC/docs folders with

    diracdoctools/scripts/dirac-docs-build-commands.py
    diracdoctools/scripts/dirac-docs-build-code.py
    diracdoctools/scripts/dirac-docs-concatenate-diraccfg.py
