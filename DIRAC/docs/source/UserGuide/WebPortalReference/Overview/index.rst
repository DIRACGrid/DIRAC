Overview
=========================

DIRAC Web Portal is a Web application which provides access to all the aspects of the DIRAC distributed computing system. It allows to monitor and control all the activities in a natural desktop application like way. In order to reach this goal DIRAC Web Portal is built using GUI elements to mimic desktop applications, such as toolbars, menus, windows buttons and so on.


Description
========================

All pages have two toolbars, one on the top and another at the bottom of the pages that contain the main navigation widgets. The top toolbar contains the main menu and reflects the logical structure of the Portal. It also allows to select active DIRAC setup. The bottom toolbar allows users to select their active group and displays the identity the user is connected with.

The mostly used layout within our Web Portal is a table on the right side of the page and a side bar on the left. Almost all data that needs to be displayed can be represented as two-dimensional matrix using a table widget. This widget has a built-in pagination mechanism and is very customizable. As a drawback, it is a bit slow to load the data into the table. On an average desktop hardware, tables with more than 100 elements can be slow to display the data.
