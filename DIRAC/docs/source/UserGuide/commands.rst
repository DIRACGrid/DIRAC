Please see the :ref:`shorthand_commands_tutorial` for an introduction and the :ref:`shorthand_cmd` section for a complete list of available short commands.

| Please note that you will need to get a proxy using the dirac-proxy-init command before you are able to use the any of the commands in the sections below.
