==================
Web App User Guide
==================


The DIRAC WebApp is a user friendly interface allowing users to interact with the DIRAC services.
It can be easily extended by particular VO or it can be integrated into some other portal.


Terms:
-------

**Application**

   A web page called application in the new portal, for example: Monitoring, Accounting, Production Management.

**Desktop**

   It is a container of different applications. Each application opens in a desktop. The desktop is your working environment.

**State**

   The State is the actual status of an application or a desktop. The State can be saved and it can be reused. A saved State can be shared within
   the VO or between users.

Concepts:
---------

Two protocols are allowed: **http** and **https**.
**http** protocol is very restricted. It only allows to access limited functionalities. It is recommended to the site administrators.
The state of applications or desktops can not be saved.
**https** protocol allows to access all functionalities of DIRAC depending on your role (DIRAC group).
The state of the application is not saved in the **URL**. The URL only contains the name of application or desktop.
For example: ``https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/s:LHCb-Production/g:lhcb_prmgr/?theme=Grey&url_state=1|AllPlots``

**Format of the URL**

Format of the URL:

#. https://: protocol
#. lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/: host.
#. s:LHCb-Production: DIRAC setup.
#. g:lhcb_prmgr : role
#. theme=Grey: it is the look and feel.
#. &url_state=1: it is desktop or application.
#. AllPlots : it is the desktop name. the default desktop is **Default**.
#. The state is a desktop: AllPlots
#. The state is an application: *LHCbDIRAC.LHCbJobMonitor.classes.LHCbJobMonitor:AllUserJobs,*
   For example: desktop and application: AllPlots,*LHCbDIRAC.LHCbJobMonitor.classes.LHCbJobMonitor:AllUserJobs,*
